                        guested with US superstar Drake, was awarded best<br>
                        contemporary song for Question Time, a seven-minute hip-<br>
                        hop track that criticises Theresa May over lack of NHS<br>
                        funding, military involvement in Syria, wage stagnation and more.

                        The track also castigates David Cameron over Brexit (“You fucked us, resigned, then sneaked out the firing line”) and ponders whether Jeremy Corbyn can be an effective, honest politician.

                        One particularly heartfelt verse attacks May over her handling of the Grenfell Tower disaster.
